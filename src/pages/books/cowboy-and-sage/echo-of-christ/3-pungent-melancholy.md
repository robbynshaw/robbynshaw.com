Have you ever been out to Justin’s Orchard, Jonathan?

“Once or twice as a kid. Why do you ask?”

I would like to go out there one last time. There is a section of
the orchard hidden off in the back where the owner grows apples to
sell to the supermarkets. He’s a good friend of mine, and he always
welcomes help back there. He’ll be busy with the front-end during
the day, so we will have plenty of space to talk, and my mind is
always clearer in the trees with the fresh scents of fall floating
around me and my hands busy with work.

We drive off from that silent shadow of a place into the country,
into the fields, into life. I watch the old, familiar trees slide
past the window, holding me in that gaze of age-old wisdom and the
farewell of old friends. The cattle stand ever lazily in the
pastures, seeming to nod as we pass by.

As we near Justin’s orchard, the bustle of children lifts like an
aura into the air around us, and I breathe it in, one last time, and
let this harvest fill my lungs. The sweet, pungent smell pains my
heart, so I let it go. I let it go. I . . . let it go.

Do you have a love story, Jonathan?

“Had. Not too long ago.”

Did it leave you, or perhaps you lost it?

“No, I know where it is. We are just–we’re here to talk about you,
Elden. We need to talk about you.”

We pull into the drive at the orchard, park, and head over to the
owner who is kneeling in the grass, telling some children a story.

“And then along came–Elden. I mean . . . Elden?”

We are heading out back, Justin, if you don’t mind. This young man
here, Jonathan, is keen to know my story. And here it is, right
Justin? Here it all is.

Justin stares into my eyes for a prolonged moment, embraces me, and
let’s me go, and I him.

So Jonathan and I head down the dusty path.

You see the boy steering that wagon, driving those horses, Jonathan?
That was me, a good number of years ago, back when Justin Sr., rest
his soul, still ran this place.

And that’s where I met her.

Let’s take a ride with him, Jonathan, please. That wagon is where my
soul takes root, in those creaky boards and over those dusty paths
with rotting apples laid out like a red carpet for our procession on
this beautiful harvest day.
