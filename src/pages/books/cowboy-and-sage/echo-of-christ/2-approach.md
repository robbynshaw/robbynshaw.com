Every beautiful dance embraces a taste of death.

“You’re gonna hang, Elden. I don’t know how else to say it. You’re
gonna hang on that tree when the dogs have had their way.”

You look into that twirling girl’s eyes and behold a soul, but you
must let it go, or she slips from your grasp.

“They have you on all of it, Elden. Five counts of–no–six counts of
murder, on conspiracy, terrorism, and treason, and the case is thick
against you. I don’t know what anyone can do for you at this point,
but all the decent people I know swear you’re a saint, so I’ll be
damned if I have your blood on my hands–literally, I guess.”

All love is a letting go. To hold a mystery, you must let it remain
as such. All love is a letting go. Every dance is a prayer.

“Anyway, I’m gonna need to be in the know on everything if we’re
gonna have a fighting chance. By all appearances you’re a forgotten
cowboy whose lost his way and fell in with a strange lot of
anarchists, so I’m gonna need one hell of a story to convince the
jury otherwise. That and a good couple trips to the barber and the
tailor for you, anyway, that’s for certain.

So, as they say, let’s hear it from the beginning.”

That’s why I’ve been thinking of that ol’ cowboy. Who can mark the
beginning of a soul? But where the tracks have dug deep ruts as they
bent sharply around a corner, these are the moments we mark as
beginnings.

Or perhaps I should look for the beginning of  my ambitions, of that
singular goal to make a name ring into eternity. The moderns call it
fame, but what a pathetic word, so empty. Nobody desires fame in the
drudges of their soul. Those before us called it glory–a crown from
the gods. I desired glory.

But of this desire there is no simple beginning, not in me or in any
of us. No, my story must begin the day that I learned that quiet,
Arabic prayer, and I etched it across my forearm and laid heavy upon
it thrice a day.

> It is glory enough for me
>
> that I should be your servant.
>
> It is grace enough for me
>
> that you should be my Lord.
