. . . run faster than I knew I could . . .

"What you got, boy, s'a restless soul. An' y'aint alone. Yes, a
pyure condition a'the times, it is.

It's like yer chasin' somethin' that ain't wantin' ta be caught, but
ya don't know what it is, an' ya don't know where it is, an' yer
soul's all too tied up ta give it up--ta give up th'ambition. An'
now them eyes a'tired--they tell yer story plain an' true--the
fatigue of ambition's laid deep in yer soul."

The old man sits by the fire calmly whittling some sort of handle.

I was once chasing some horses . . .

"Once? Yer chasin'em now, boy? Maybe you need to give up on the
thought that someday yer chase a'gonna be over. Maybe you need ta
stop tryin' ta find the end a'the chase, some satisfyin' solution
that'll wrap up yer destiny. Out there's a world a'hurt an' pain,
boy, an' you ain't barely touched the surface a'the tears yet. If
you got half a heart an' half a brain, that plow's never gonna rest.
The harvest comes every year, but the sun never stops rollin' by.

Yer fatigued, boy, and it ain't 'cause ya can't find yer destiny.
Yer fatigued 'cause you ain't learned how ta find yer strength, how
ta breathe it through yerÂ  nostrils, how ta find that strength in
the dull hours and build it up.

You figure out that motion, boy, an' you teach it to yer age. Yes, a
pyure condition a'the times, it is."

"Elden? Still there? And then what? The horses?"

Oh yes. I was once chasing some horses.
