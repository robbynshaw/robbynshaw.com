The deep crags of this soul are slow to thaw.

“Y’never told me what formed ‘em, how th’ice crept inside yer chest.”

The Spirit of God walked away from me like a haunting morning
mist–in the depths of my passion and zeal, He walked out of my soul,
and I walked onward.

I walked through the valley of the shadow of death. To find a place
where the light might peer into the valley floor, I walked.

And I walked till the valley ended in a cold stone face as high as
the dark moon. And I beat the rocks until my knuckles bled dark
crimson streaks across the stone. And at last, I turned back to
retrace my steps.

“An’at’s where I found ya.”

But still I scour the valley floor searching for the Light Who Won’t
Be Seen–that She may never leave my sight again.

Within me abides no ‘though.’ I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death.

I laugh–deeper, stronger, cleaner.

And I fear no evil.

“Where, then, is the rod and the staff?”
