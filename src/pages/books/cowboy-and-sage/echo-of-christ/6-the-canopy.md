I swerved through the trees, ducking under branches and dodging
customers, shooting a diagonal through the orchard following the
sound of the ever growing distant hooves. The rain smacked into my
eyes and I into a man, spilling his bushel across the
path.

I turned to yell back an apology, but before the words were halfway
out I had burst through the last row of trees onto the dirt path,
tripped over a pile of empty bushel baskets, and crashed face down
into the mud.

I jumped up and looked down the road, but the horses were nowhere to
be seen, and the sound of the hooves had disappeared underneath the
heavy rolls of thunder and the constant chatter of rain against the
leaves. In a solemn desperation I began to jog down the path,
looking through the crossroads in vain and wandering almost aimlessly.

Finally I gave up and headed towards a great oak tree where the
workers gather for breaks and to set out the loaded bushels for pick
up. I knew that there were benches over there, and I was tired and
in need of clearing my mind to prepare my story for Justin. So I
turned down a little path and headed around the bend.

As I cleared the last apple tree on the bend, the sides of the great
oak rose before me, and underneath the canopy of branches stood a
sopping angel gently comforting my renegade horses. Piles of
gathered apples flanked the scene like the emperors gold, and  her
eyes met mine.
