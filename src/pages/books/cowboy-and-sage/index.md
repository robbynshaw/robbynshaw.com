[**"Cowboy &amp; Sage"**](/cowboy-and-sage) is a narrative, a guide, a
dialogue, and the history of an echo--the sound of the Comforter
roaming the earth, crackling through the dusty alleyways, winnowing
the wheat, testing for fruit.

"Cowboy &amp; Sage" is the history of a movement of which you may
only have heard faint whispers in dark corners--**The Echo of
Christ**. And you will not find the voices speaking
louder. The Echo moves where you will her.

You may find a piece of the history within yourself, as I have, or
you may wonder where the boundaries of fiction and reality lie, as I
have as well. But nonetheless, I will present to you what I have
found.

I am currently transcribing a narrative that has been passed on to
me from a very trusted colleague. The book is simply called "Cowboy
&amp; Sage," and being the primary source for this clandestine
movement, I have named the website appropriately.

However, the book is rather large, with portions missing and
incomplete, so I have divided up the task of transcription into more
attainable and digestible bits, being for now the
[**"Prelude"**](/cowboy-and-sage-prelude) and **"The Echo of
Christ,"** with more to come as I am able.

I hope you find that I do justice to the task at hand, and of the
material presented, you may be the judge.

But take heed, it is not a book you judge, but a spirit.

And a spirit must be worn.

Sincerely,
