“Arise son, the mornin’ comes. Let us bathe.”

I follow him a mile or so into a cool, clear pool, and in we settle.

“We men’ll have our enemies, no doubtin’ that son, but ain’t no
denyin’ we stand at the top’a the chain though neither. What power
we don’t have, we will, an’ what force we haven’t tamed, we’ll try.”

I can feel the grime of hot, lazy days rinsing off my neck.

“But the cougar finds himself satisfied when the day’s meat runs
red. What’a man? What’a you? What meat must run red?”

I wonder what the water must have felt like in Eden. Was it warm or
cool, lazy or virile? What blood was washed in those waters? What
instructions were given in that bath?
