Swiftly through the sun drenched grass, following a song who sinks
sadly and faints slowly among the trees.

We doubt.

Out here, and hungry, the scents run strong but yet, the mirages
hold sway. The murmuring tires and engines slide through the forest
filter, a quiet deafening, a yearning for nameless powers and strong
tonics waiting to be discovered. The quiet roar floats like a damp
cloud over all the land.

In the fog, everything becomes bland.

The song is silent. She makes no defense. And so, I doubt.

What of Truth? What of power? This feeble elixir called
satisfactionâ€“no, worse, contentment. And my straining in this
hapless world will sink with me, silent into the grave. And the
Siren? What song can be sung and not lull to the grave, strong
pleasures in a dream which wakes to the cold and black. 	And she
stands alone, singing, if yet a wraith . . . but a wraith always,
and a siren yet again.

These gods that stand in story and the gods that sit in stories high
sing songs too many, songs too long, and I walk swiftly now, and
doubt, that anything is heard and doubt, that anything is heard at
all.
