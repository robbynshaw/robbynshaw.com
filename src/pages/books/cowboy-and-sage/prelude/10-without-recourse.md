I lie flat on my back trying to dream of sleep. I stare at the
stars–the eyes of my beautiful wife–distant, waiting, disappointed,
flickering.

I clench the grass in my palm, ripping the roots loudly from the
soil. His rhythmic, heavy breathing taunts me from a few yards away.
Energy flicks through my fingers like a bug crawling up my shoulder.
I toss and turn through the night until my body forgets to fight and
my mind forgets that I am waking.
