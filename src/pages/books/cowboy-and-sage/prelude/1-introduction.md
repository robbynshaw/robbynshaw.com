“The blood in these ol’ veins ‘a
growin’ stale, and I suspect yours’ too. Yes, I suspect that’s why
you’ve come.”

We stand on the porch looking out over an overgrown field. He claims
you shouldn’t think while sitting–something about lazy thoughts.
There is a long pause.

“Ya see, I use’ta till that soil. But I been watchin’ that field
grow now for five years. You got five years, boy, to watch that
field grow?”

In five years my oldest will be nine. I’ve damn near lost four
already. I don’t have five years.

“Well, I reckon it’ll take longer’n that to grow up through that
ballast yonder.”
