"And what strength do you bring, boy?”

I dream now only of peace.

The rotations of the earth bear hard on some of us. We strain to
push it forward then get crushed beneath, dragged behind the
movement once it starts. Our wrinkles stretch out as we squint into
daylight, reaching out to soak in the rays which our hearts cannot
grasp.

I dream, though once my strength overtook the night.

These memories, so slow were they forged, in meadows who breathe in
a cadence marked by years, in swing-sets who awaited our return, in
trees whose branches yet began to curve a smile as our vibrant ages
came and passed.

These memories . . . We think in hushed tones, for they have
passed–silent, shrouded, still–cold as Juliette’s wet lips.

I dream, but the darkness stills my soul.

“Been a heavy winter, son, but be wary: the wounded cougar’s often
tamed. We are renegades, son. We will not be tamed.”
