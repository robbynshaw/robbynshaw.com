Here marks a moment.

Slide out the slender solace. Let it light. Away with my remains.

The empty paper packet, forlorn, weeps tears of white and gold,
cries out, then crumples with the task.

“Where these weeds grow wild, son, an’ not just there, the hunters
come out at night.”

My eyes rest still on the heat, but he passes through this ring of
warmth into the cool silence of the evening air.

I hesitate, letting the smoke smolder in my lungs, letting the light
caress my mind. For once. For twice. For freedom.

Follow after.

“This modern man’ll hunt wit’ his mind in a haze. He sits in a stoop
an’ drinks to a stupor. He waits for his brother to build him a
tower then wipes it with a grin across his cheeks.

Not us, son. Tonight we come not only ta kill but ta bring life.
Tonight we hunt for water, for soul, for vitality.

We will not wait and waste our instincts ta rot. We will not take
the foolish prey. Tonight, a sharp mind an’ a clear eye will take
the daughter’s dowry. We will find her in the hunt, and we will stop
her breath.”

I glance behind. I fear the fire may spread without our vigil. I
must put it out.

“The fire will burn with or without us, son, an’ it may try an’
follow us, but I reckon we ain’t found water enough ta put it
a’rest. The time comes now ta let the fire have its place. We walk
the darker path.

Yes, ta hunt what won’t be hunted, we walk the darker path.”
