“Ya figured out why ya do that yet, son?”

My lighter clicks and blows out in the darkening breeze. Try again.
I listen to the tip of the cigarette sizzle in the quiet dusk.

I’ve spent hours–hell, years–pondering that same question. But no
answers come.

“Y’ever wonder why them bored ol’ men turn pedophiles?”

The breeze slowly settles in the weeds.

“I reckon you quit smoking, you’re gonna find something
else–something just as . . . something else to retaliate on.”

I catch the bats as they start snatching up their prey. I think back
to all those frustrated nights, lying angry next to a young, wounded
wife. I slip my hand in my pocket, pull my elbow in close, and
breathe in the coarse, white smoke.
