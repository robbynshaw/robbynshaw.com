I notice now that I’ve veered painfully off course. The whirring of
the distant roads has dragged my attention in nauseating turns of
desperate jealousy and vehement disgust. The peaceful lilt in the
Siren’s melody is all but lost to me now.

I try to calmly retrace my steps, but each thorn that scrapes my
side and bird that breaks my concentration ignites an instant rage
that swells from within my gut, permeated by my growing hunger. I
lash out at the victims, breaking the twigs and screaming at the
singers, and I stop.

I fall on my knees, and I remember my children. The chirping birds.
The music. The stinging side. I listen.

I quiet my mind. Oh, to rest, and rest again, and rest at last. The
muscles sigh and fall to the floor. The peaceful lilt rises above
the rhythm, and I catch it, hold it, smell it, breathe it.

And I mark this place an altar. Remind me trees and chorus,
evermore, to find this place of meditation, always, and never in
forgetful lines to wander from the lilt.

Forgive me, Father. Forgive the sins of the father. Please.
