I struggle to keep up. He graces through this
prairie-turned-a-forest like a swooping bird. He rises up a fallen
trunk, and I clamber up behind him. We are standing in a clearing
whose breast must have been broken by fire a hundred acres wide and
deep not more than a year before this day.

“The old trackers’a this land had owl eyes for a track’n the night,
but we don’t come here atop this trunk ta see, son.

In a clearing such like this ‘en, th’air is starved for life, so the
scents grow stronger in the wind, an’ the sounds grow smoother with
the breeze.

Are you hearin’ what I’m sayin’ son? Tonight we track what ain’t ta
be tracked. The ol’ hunters’a this land headed for the grounds atop
an empty stomach, an’ the kill was their feast. A hungry man’s a man
with senses twice a’clear and fingers twice a’sharp if he holds the
will ta teach ‘em.

But this modern man, if he hunts hungry, he hunts a fool led by a
whore. His senses run him useless. He can’t hold such passions and
keep his head above water.

We will sleep in this field tonight, son, an’ the night beyond. We
have watched the fire burn, now’s the time to watch th’ash settle
an’ the clearing gather into view. Soon enough, we will hunger for
the feast.”
