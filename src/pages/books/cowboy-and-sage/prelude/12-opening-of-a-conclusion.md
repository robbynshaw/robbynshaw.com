I find myself waking again from a cloud of dreary haze. He is
sitting on the log, listening to the wind.

“Ya hear that, son? ‘At sweet smooth sound’s what we been killin’ ta
hear . . .”

That song. The music wafts across the meadow, faintly and slow,
still as the warming blood.

I know that voice. She remembers me. She has been waiting.

I must find her. I will bring her a sacrifice. I will chase down the
dancing doe and strangle it with my bare hands, hold it high above
my head, and lay it at her feet.	No. She mustn’t know. I will
kill the doe when it nears my Siren. I will feast in her vision. She
will long for the flesh. The meat will run red.

“Take this knife, son. But don’t f’get ta bring us back some wood.
The darkness is yet cold for us. Bring us light. And salt. And hope.”
