If it's loneliness, it must be self-sustained. Some ever-long grasping which perpetuates the void.

Only in the Post-Modern can the theologian's thoughts be judged by their sexiness.

It's this slow moving boat, going nowhere.

This the nagging question, from what can we help someone else? Out of which storehouse and to which?

In a desert, surrounded only by threats and conquests. This, the atomic life.

Is it pleasure, tyrant over the soul, or a far deeper misfortune? --a void.

Let us be blind that we may yet continue striving.

The great lie of capitalism: that money motivates. This is why the great capitalists of our time are only beacons of our decay. Money to what end? To fill which hole? The eyes always speak.

If any soul is left, the uncovered neurosis no longer drives. The artist without his muse.

To speak of *my* good is to speak of the good without context. To speak of *the* good is to speak of the good without context, that is, evil?

Perhaps only the Siren calls us to greatness. And with such empty, throbbing beauty.

Reflection--the only mood which is not.

At first the agnostic demands proof. Before too long, he asks for motivation, the far more cruel question. What motivates the tree to grow?

We begin to scrape the earth for answers. Are they still there? Perhaps only the faces, glowing grey in the bog. Glowing lights.
